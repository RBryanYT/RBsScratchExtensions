# How to install Ancient Dungeon VR Mods on PCVR
![Note: This tutorial is made for PCVR on Windows](https://img.shields.io/badge/NOTE-This_tutorial_is_made_for_PCVR_on_Windows.-fc3232)
## Meta Quest Store ADVR
Just go to `C:/Program Files/Oculus/Software/Software/erthu-ancient-dungeon-vr/Ancient_Dungeon_Data/StreamingAssets/mods` and drag and drop your mod folders to install them. *(Don't open the game until the copy action is complete)*

You should now have mods installed for your Ancient Dungeon VR!

## Steam ADVR
Open your Steam library, right-click ADVR and choose **Manage > Browse local files**

Now go to `Ancient_Dungeon_Data/StreamingAssets/mods` and drag and drop your mod folders to install them. *(Don't open the game until the copy action is complete)*

You should now have mods installed for your Ancient Dungeon VR!

## Where to enable mods
To enable mods, just open the game and look right in the settings menu.

Click any mod to enable/disable it, and reload game to apply changes.

## I don't see any mods
### Zip folder pain
Look inside of `ADVR_Mods/<the mod you installed>` and see if there is a `mod.modinfo` file.

If there isn't, try reinstalling the mod with whatever folder contains the `mod.modinfo` file.
### Wrong location
Did you go to `Ancient_Dungeon_Data/StreamingAssets/mods`?
### Mod incompatibility
Have you checked if the mod is compatible with whatever version of the game you are using?

If it isn't, that's why it isn't showing.

# How to enable developer mode on a Meta Quest
## Making a developer account
Go to [dashboard.oculus.com](https://dashboard.oculus.com/) and sign in to your Meta account.

Now make a name for your orginization, if you never plan on publishing VR games, name this anything.

Once done, you should now have a developer account. This is not developer mode however!

## Enabling developer mode
For this, you need the Oculus app, now known as the Meta Horizon app.

Once you install it, sign in to your Meta account again.

Now click the headset button at the top left, choose which Quest you want to turn on developer mode for, and click *Headset settings*.

If *Headset settings* is grayed out, you need to turn on bluetooth and connect your phone to your Quest.

Once that's done go to `Headset settings > Developer mode` and turn it on.

Now just restart your Quest and you're done!
